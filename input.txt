  	Section Information:  Section Type - IN-PERSON SECTION. Special Topics in CS: Trusted Computing and Emerging Attack. This course introduces the paradigm of trusted computing and its evolution over the past decade. Common trusted computing technologies are characterized and categorized. Their application in various academic proposals and industrial solutions is also explained. To generalize it, the positioning of trusted computing as a hardware-based defense approach to trustworthy program execution is shown in a bigger picture and compared with other types of defenses/attacks. Recent (new) attack vectors concerning trustworthy program execution are also reviewed. Prerequisite(s): COMP3000 with a minimum grade of C-.
